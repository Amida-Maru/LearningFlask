                            There is a number of different services online that allow you to follow esports events in
                            League of Legends such as YouTube and Twitch as well as some proprietary services however
                            these are beyond the scope of this guide. It is important to emphasize that
                            there are different esports leagues based on the geographic location for example American,
                            Asian or European. All of the esports leagues follow their own streaming schedule which
                            means that some esports events are transmitted only during certain days of the week in
                            particular regions. The current esports schedule can be checked on an official page of an
                            esports league or on lol.fancdom.com (more information about this can be found under the
                            "Useful Websites" section).

                            The esports hierarchy in League of Legends consists of two separate levels (primary and secondary). The primary tier
                            which is the highest esports distinction in League of Legends is reserved only for the best
                            players from a given region. There are currently 13 primary tier leagues in League of
                            Legends (see the attached map for more details). For example, LEC is the European primary
                            tier region that affiliates the best players from the European continent. These kinds of
                            players compete with each other in official league matches during an esports season
                            (normally there is the spring esports season between January and March and the summer
                            esports season between June and August).

 text-justify: inter-character;">
                            Upon each season's end 3 best teams from a primary league who manage to score the highest
                            number of wins against other teams from the respected primary tier league qualify for
                            international tournaments. The Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) tournament takes place after
                            the spring season and it lasts till May. During MSI the best teams from each region compete
                            against each other in order to win the MSI trophy and recognition on the international
                            stage. The second tournament is called the World Championship and it takes place after the
                            summer season. The World Championship is considered the biggest and most prestigious
                            tournament in League of Legends where the best teams from each region fight for the title of the best team in the
                            world and attractive prize money of several million dollars.

                            The secondary tier leagues are usually reserved for players who were not able to secure an
                            esports contract with a team from the primary tier but are still considered to be one of the
                            best players in their respective countries. These kinds of players normally compete with
                            each other in country-specific leagues for example in Poland there is a secondry tier league
                            called "Ultraliga" that is a home for the best players from Poland. Similarly, players from
                            primary tier leagues, the players compete with each other in official league matches during
                            an esports season (normally there is the spring esports season between January and March and
                            the summer esports season between June and August).

 text-justify: inter-character;">
                            Upon each season's end 3 best teams from a secondary league that manage to score the highest
                            number of wins against other teams from the respected secondary tier league qualify for an
                            international tournament consisting of the best second-tier teams from a given region. For
                            instance, in Europe such a tournament is called "European Masters" and it takes place twice
                            a year at the end of an esports season. The qualified teams compete with one another to win
                            the title of the European Masters champion and attractive prize money of several thousand
                            euros. Apart from that, the best players from each team have a chance to show off their
                            skills on the international stage to scouts from primary league teams.
